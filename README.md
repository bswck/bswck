### `about`
I'm a software developer and programming teacher.

#### `education`
As a technical trainer I mainly focus on Python and Git, but am happy to explain whatever else is in the way.

Feel free to reach out via e-mail ([bartosz@ilikepython.com](mailto://bartosz@ilikepython.com)) especially if:
- you are a beginner willing to learn how to think like a programmer
- you are a professional willing to get deep understanding of particular concepts in Python

I conduct lessons in English and Polish, as preferred.
