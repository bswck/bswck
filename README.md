I learn Python, I teach Python, and I enjoy it.

### My hall of fame üèÜ
* [Samuel Colvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin), for _amazing_ knowledge and implementing _astounding_ ideas that change the world, ranging from [smokeshow](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/smokeshow) to [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic). 
* [Jason R. Coombs](https://github.com/jaraco), for teaching me how to _think Python_ through his code. For being professional at observing and inventing solutions in _over 100 open-source projects_.
* [Charlie R. Marsh](https://github.com/charliermarsh), for putting enormous effort into creating _the fastest, yet educative_ [tools for the Python ecosystem](https://astral.sh/) to have ever existed. For being such a kind person during his challenging journey.
* [Will McGugan](https://github.com/willmcgugan), for making the universe of TUIs [_beatifully simple_ and _simply beautiful_](https://www.textualize.io/) at once. For presenting world-class skill at Python and also being super-kind :)

Open source allows everyone to change the world for the better.<br />
**Let's do it, too!** üöÄ

### My projects üñ•Ô∏è
* [configzen](https://github.com/bswck/configzen), a library for reading and writing configuration files, both synchronously and asynchronously, without losing comments and with ‚ú® magic features ‚ú® including variable interpolation and multi-file configuration allowed by built-in transclusion mechanism.
* [proxyvars](https://github.com/bswck/proxyvars), a small library for creating proxy objects that use callbacks to determine their state. Inspired by [_werkzeug_](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) that powers [_flask_](https://github.com/pallets/flask). üöÄ
* [runtime_generics](https://github.com/bswck/runtime_generics), a light-weight module that allows to reuse explicitly specified type arguments passed to generic classes.
