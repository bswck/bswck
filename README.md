[Check out my resume! üîó](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bswck/bswck/master/RESUME.pdf)

### Projects I authored üñ•Ô∏è
* [_skeleton_](https://github.com/bswck/skeleton), a generic Python project skeleton that uses [_copier_](https://github.com/copier-org/copier).
* [_configzen_](https://github.com/bswck/configzen), a library for reading and writing configuration files without losing comments. It offers some ‚ú® magical features ‚ú®, such as data validation (thanks, _pydantic_!), variable interpolation, multi-file configuration (built-in transclusion mechanisms), partial saving & reloading, and much more.
* [_proxyvars_](https://github.com/bswck/proxyvars), a small library for creating proxy objects that use custom callbacks to determine their state. Inspired by [_werkzeug_](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) that powers [_flask_](https://github.com/pallets/flask). üöÄ
* [_runtime_generics_](https://github.com/bswck/runtime_generics), a light-weight module that allows to reuse explicitly specified type arguments passed to generic classes.<br /><br />

### My hall of fame üèÜ
* [≈Åukasz Langa](https://github.com/ambv) for his excellent knowledge, contributions to (C)Python, creating [Black](https://github.com/psf/black#readme), [PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/), fascinating talks on advanced Python topics, and much much more.
* [Samuel Colvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin), for _amazing_ knowledge and implementing _astounding_ ideas that change the world, ranging from _[smokeshow](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/smokeshow)_ to _[pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic)_. 
* [Jason R. Coombs](https://github.com/jaraco), for teaching me how to _think Python_ through his code. For being professional at observing and inventing solutions in _over 100 open-source projects_.
* [Charlie R. Marsh](https://github.com/charliermarsh), for putting enormous effort into creating _the fastest, yet educative_ [tools for the Python ecosystem](https://astral.sh/) to have ever existed. For being such a kind person during his challenging journey.
* [Will McGugan](https://github.com/willmcgugan), for making the universe of TUIs [_beautifully simple_ and _simply beautiful_](https://www.textualize.io/) at once. For presenting world-class skill at Python and also being super-kind :)

Open source allows everyone to change the world.<br />
